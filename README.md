# behaviour-model
In this proyect, we model the behaviour of a subject in his own home with mixture models of von Mises distribution. Additionally, we propose a method for detecting anomalies by extending the CUSUM algorithm. EM algorithm is used for estimate the parameters of the mixture models and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is implemented.

The proyect abstract is available in Memoria.pdf
